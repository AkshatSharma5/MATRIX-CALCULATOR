## 1. Matrix Addition 
This script performs matrix addition between two matrices A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
```matlab
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];  
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12];  
C = matrix_addition(A, B);  
disp(C);
```

## 2. Matrix Subtraction 
This script performs matrix subtraction between two matrices  A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
```matlab
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];  
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12];  
C = matrix_subtraction(A, B);  
disp(C);
```

## 3. Matrix Multiplication 
This script performs matrix multiplication between two matrices  A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
```matlab
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];  
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12];  
C = matrix_multiplication(A, B);  
disp(C);
```

## 4. Column-wise Division
This script performs column-wise division of matrix  A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
```matlab
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];  
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12];  
C = colwise_division(A, B);  
disp(C);
```
