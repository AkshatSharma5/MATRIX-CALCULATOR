# MATLAB Matrix Operations üìä
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for performing basic matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and column-wise division.

# üìÇ Files and Usage
## 1. Matrix Addition ‚ûï
File: matrix_addition.m

This script performs matrix addition between two matrices A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
`A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; <br />
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]; <br />
C = matrix_addition(A, B); <br />
disp(C);`

## 2. Matrix Subtraction ‚ûñ
File: matrix_subtraction.m

This script performs matrix subtraction between two matrices  A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
`A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; <br />
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]; <br />
C = matrix_subtraction(A, B); <br />
disp(C);`

## 3. Matrix Multiplication ‚úñÔ∏è
File: matrix_multiplication.m

This script performs matrix multiplication between two matrices  A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
`A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; <br />
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]; <br />
C = matrix_multiplication(A, B); <br />
disp(C);`

4. Column-wise Division ‚ûó
File: colwise_division.m

This script performs column-wise division of matrix  A nd B.

**Example Usage:**
`A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]; <br />
B = [7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]; <br />
C = colwise_division(A, B); <br />
disp(C);`
